## Components and Interfaces

### Authentication Service

**Purpose**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and session management.

**Key Components**:
- JWT token management with refresh token rotation
- OAuth2 integration for social login
- Role-based access control (Writer, Reader, Studio, Admin)
- Multi-factor authentication for high-value accounts

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST /auth/register - User registration
POST /auth/login - User authentication
POST /auth/refresh - Token refresh
POST /auth/logout - Session termination
GET /auth/profile - User profile retrieval
PUT /auth/profile - Profile updates
```

**Design Rationale**: Separate authentication service enables independent scaling and security updates. JWT tokens provide stateless authentication suitable for mobile clients.

### User Management Service

**Purpose**: Handles user profiles, preferences, and account management.

**Key Components**:
- User profile management (writers vs readers)
- Preference storage (language, genres, notifications)
- Subscription and membership management
- Social features (following, blocking, reporting)

**Database Schema**:
```sql
users (id, email, username, role, created_at, updated_at)
user_profiles (user_id, display_name, bio, avatar_url, preferences)
user_subscriptions (user_id, plan_type, status, expires_at)
user_relationships (follower_id, following_id, relationship_type)
```

### Content Management Service

**Purpose**: Core content creation, storage, and delivery functionality.

**Key Components**:
- Story and chapter management
- Content versioning and history
- Metadata management (tags, categories, ratings)
- Content moderation and approval workflows

**API Design**:
```
POST /stories - Create new story
GET /stories/{id} - Retrieve story details
PUT /stories/{id} - Update story metadata
POST /stories/{id}/chapters - Add new chapter
GET /stories/{id}/chapters/{chapter_id} - Get chapter content
PUT /chapters/{id} - Update chapter content
```

**File Storage Strategy**:
- Original content stored in encrypted format
- CDN distribution for global access
- Automatic backup and versioning
- Content compression for mobile delivery

**Design Rationale**: Separate content service allows independent scaling based on read/write patterns. Versioning ensures IP protection while enabling content updates.

### IP Protection Service

**Purpose**: Provides cryptographic proof of authorship and rights management.

**Key Components**:
- Digital fingerprinting using SHA-256 hashing
- Timestamp authority integration
- Certificate of Authorship generation
- Blockchain registration (optional)
- Plagiarism detection tools

**IP Registration Flow**:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Writer
    participant ContentService
    participant IPService
    participant Blockchain
    
    Writer->>ContentService: Publish Chapter
    ContentService->>IPService: Register Content
    IPService->>IPService: Generate Hash + Timestamp
    IPService->>Blockchain: Optional Registration
    IPService->>ContentService: Return IP Certificate
    ContentService->>Writer: Confirm Publication
```

**Database Schema**:
```sql
ip_registrations (id, content_id, hash, timestamp, certificate_url)
ip_certificates (id, registration_id, certificate_data, blockchain_tx)
licensing_agreements (id, content_id, licensee_id, terms, revenue_share)
```

**Design Rationale**: Cryptographic hashing provides tamper-proof evidence of creation time. Blockchain integration offers additional verification for high-value content.

### Payment Processing Service

**Purpose**: Handles all monetary transactions, revenue distribution, and financial reporting.

**Key Components**:
- Multi-currency coin system
- Subscription management
- Revenue sharing calculations
- Payout processing
- Financial reporting and tax compliance

**Revenue Distribution Logic**:
```python
def calculate_revenue_share(transaction_type, amount):
    if transaction_type == "coin_purchase":
        writer_share = amount * 0.70  # 70% to writer
        platform_share = amount * 0.30  # 30% to platform
    elif transaction_type == "subscription":
        # Distributed based on engagement metrics
        writer_share = calculate_engagement_share(amount)
    elif transaction_type == "licensing":
        writer_share = amount * 0.85  # 85% to writer
        platform_share = amount * 0.15  # 15% to platform
    
    return writer_share, platform_share
```

**Payment Gateway Integration**:
- Stripe for international payments
- Regional payment providers (M-Pesa, Payme, etc.)
- Cryptocurrency support for global accessibility
- Automated tax calculation and reporting

### AI Enhancement Service

**Key Components**:
- Translation service integration (Google Translate, DeepL)
- Text-to-speech conversion with voice selection
- Content adaptation tools (script generation)
- Quality assessment and improvement suggestions

**Translation Workflow**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Original Content] --> B[Language Detection]
    B --> C[Translation API]
    C --> D[Quality Check]
    D --> E[Manual Review Option]
    E --> F[Published Translation]
    F --> G[Sync with Original]
```

**Audiobook Generation**:
- Voice selection based on content genre and target audience
- Chapter-level audio generation with consistent narrator
- Audio quality optimization for mobile streaming
- Synchronization markers for text-audio alignment

**Design Rationale**: AI services are separated to enable independent scaling and easy integration of new AI providers. Asynchronous processing ensures responsive user experience.

### Analytics Service

**Purpose**: Collects, processes, and presents performance metrics for creators and platform optimization.

**Key Components**:
- Real-time engagement tracking
- Revenue analytics and forecasting
- Reader behavior analysis
- Content performance metrics
- A/B testing framework

**Metrics Collection**:
```javascript
// Client-side tracking
trackEvent('chapter_read', {
  story_id: storyId,
  chapter_id: chapterId,
  read_duration: duration,
  completion_percentage: percentage
});

// Server-side aggregation
aggregateMetrics('daily_engagement', {
  story_id: storyId,
  total_reads: count,
  average_duration: avg_duration,

```

### Payment and Revenue Models

```sql
-- Coin system for microtransactions
CREATE TABLE coin_packages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    coin_amount INTEGER,
    price_usd DECIMAL(10,2),
    bonus_percentage DECIMAL(5,2)
);

-- Transaction tracking
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    transaction_type VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Revenue distribution
CREATE TABLE revenue_shares (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    content_id UUID,
    writer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id),
    writer_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    platform_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Error Handling

### Error Classification and Response Strategy

**Client Errors (4xx)**:
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input validation
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required
- 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions
- 404 Not Found: Resource doesn't exist
- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limiting

**Server Errors (5xx)**:
- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected system failure
- 502 Bad Gateway: External service unavailable
- 503 Service Unavailable: Temporary overload
- 504 Gateway Timeout: External service timeout

**Error Response Format**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_CONTENT_FORMAT",
    "message": "Chapter content must be between 100 and 10000 characters",
    "details": {
      "field": "content",
      "current_length": 50,
      "min_length": 100,
      "max_length": 10000
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

### Resilience Patterns

**Circuit Breaker**: Protect against cascading failures in external service calls
**Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
**Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to cached content when services are unavailable
**Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate critical services to prevent total system failure

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Health Checks**:
- Service availability monitoring
- Database connection health
- External API response times
- Queue processing delays

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Error rate > 5% triggers immediate alert
- Response time > 2s triggers warning
- Payment processing failures trigger critical alert
- IP service unavailability triggers urgent alert

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Service layer business logic testing
- Data model validation testing
- Utility function testing
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- API endpoint testing with real databases
- Service-to-service communication testing
- Payment flow integration testing
- AI service integration testing

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete user journey testing (registration to monetization)
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Performance testing under load
- Security penetration testing

### Testing Tools and Framework
```python
# FastAPI testing example
def test_create_story():
    response = client.post("/stories", json={
        "title": "Test Story",
        "description": "A test story",
        "genre": "fiction"
    }, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {auth_token}"})
    
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["title"] == "Test Story"
    assert "id" in response.json()
```

### Performance Testing
- Load testing for concurrent users (target: 10,000 concurrent readers)
- Stress testing for peak traffic scenarios
- Database performance testing for large content volumes
- CDN performance testing for global content delivery

**Performance Targets**:
- API response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Page load time < 2s on 3G networks
- Content search results < 500ms
- Payment processing < 5s end-to-end

This design provides a robust, scalable foundation for the Legato platform while addressing all requirements for IP protection, global monetization, and mobile-first user experience.
