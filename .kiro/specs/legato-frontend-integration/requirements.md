# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the Legato frontend integration with backend APIs to create a fully functional MVP. The current frontend has disconnected auth pages, incomplete dashboards, missing pages, and uses mock data instead of real backend integration. This spec will ensure all user flows work end-to-end with actual API data for a compelling demo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register, login, and have my authentication state properly managed across the application, so that I can access protected features and maintain my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL call the auth service API and create a new account
2. WHEN a user submits the login form THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the backend and store the JWT token
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL persist the auth state and display user-specific content
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the auth token and redirect to the login page
5. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 2: User Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As a reader/user, I want a dashboard that shows my reading activity, bookmarked stories, and reading recommendations, so that I can easily continue my reading journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their reading history from the backend
2. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL show bookmarked/favorited stories
3. WHEN a user is on their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display personalized story recommendations
4. WHEN a user clicks on a story from their dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to the story reading page
5. IF a user has no reading history THEN the system SHALL display trending stories as recommendations

### Requirement 3: Writer Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As a writer, I want a separate dashboard that shows my published stories, analytics, earnings, and writing tools, so that I can manage my content and track my success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a writer accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their published stories with real metrics
2. WHEN a writer views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL show earnings and payment information
3. WHEN a writer is on their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display story analytics (views, ratings, comments)
4. WHEN a writer clicks "Create New Story" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the story creation form
5. WHEN a writer clicks on one of their stories THEN the system SHALL show story management options

### Requirement 4: Story Creation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a writer, I want to create stories with complete metadata including cover images, so that my stories are properly presented to readers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a writer creates a new story THEN the system SHALL allow them to upload a cover image
2. WHEN a writer submits a story form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields including title, description, genre, and cover
3. WHEN a story is created successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect to the story management page
4. WHEN a writer uploads a cover image THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size constraints
5. IF story creation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages

### Requirement 5: Story Reading Experience

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to click on story titles to immediately start reading, so that I can quickly access content without extra navigation steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a story title THEN the system SHALL navigate directly to the first chapter or reading page
2. WHEN a user is reading a story THEN the system SHALL display chapter navigation controls
3. WHEN a user finishes a chapter THEN the system SHALL provide options to continue to the next chapter
4. WHEN a user bookmarks a story THEN the system SHALL save their reading progress
5. WHEN a user returns to a story THEN the system SHALL resume from their last reading position

### Requirement 6: Author Profile Pages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view author profiles with their published works and bio information, so that I can discover more content from writers I enjoy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an author name THEN the system SHALL display the author's profile page
2. WHEN viewing an author profile THEN the system SHALL show the author's published stories
3. WHEN on an author profile THEN the system SHALL display author bio and statistics
4. WHEN a user follows an author THEN the system SHALL update the follow status in the backend
5. WHEN viewing an author profile THEN the system SHALL show the author's total followers and story count

### Requirement 7: Story Discovery Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover stories through search, trending lists, and categories that show real data from the backend, so that I can find content that interests me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messaging

### Requirement 8: Community Features Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to rate stories, leave comments, and interact with the community, so that I can engage with content and other readers.

3. WHEN viewing story comments THEN the system SHALL display real comments from the community service
4. WHEN a user likes a comment THEN the system SHALL update the like count in the backend
5. WHEN displaying story ratings THEN the system SHALL show aggregated ratings from the community service

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when actions are processing or when errors occur, so that I understand the system status and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show offline status and retry options

5. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton screens or loading placeholders

### Requirement 10: Navigation and Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation that works across all pages and properly handles authentication states, so that I can move through the application seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
