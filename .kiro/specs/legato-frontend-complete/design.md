# Legato Frontend Complete Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the comprehensive frontend development for Legato, building upon the existing Next.js/React foundation to create a complete, beautiful, and highly functional user interface. The design focuses on creating an enhanced landing page with 10+ sections, all necessary application pages, and seamless API integration while maintaining the mobile-first approach and warm, storytelling-focused aesthetic.

The frontend will leverage the existing architecture while expanding it significantly to include enhanced user experiences, comprehensive page coverage, and advanced interactive features that showcase Legato's unique value proposition as a platform where "stories become IP."
