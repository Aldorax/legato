# Legato - Where Stories Become IP

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Legato came from witnessing the struggles of talented writers, particularly in Africa, MENA, and the Global South, who create amazing stories but lack the infrastructure to protect their intellectual property and monetize their work fairly. We saw how platforms like Wattpad and Webnovel, while popular, don't prioritize IP protection or provide clear pathways for writers to license their work to studios and publishers.

We were inspired by the idea that every story has the potential to become valuable intellectual property - whether it's the next Netflix series, a bestselling novel, or a blockbuster movie. But writers needed a platform that would not only help them reach global audiences but also protect their rights and ensure they get paid fairly when their stories are adapted.
