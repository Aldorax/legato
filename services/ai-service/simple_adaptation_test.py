    Detective Sarah Martinez pushed open the heavy wooden door of the abandoned warehouse. 
    The rusty hinges groaned in protest, echoing through the cavernous space. Dust particles 
    danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that pierced through broken windows.
    
    "Police! Is anyone in here?" she called out, her voice bouncing off the concrete walls.
    
    From somewhere in the shadows came a low, gravelly voice: "You're too late, Detective. 
    The game is already over."
    
    Sarah's hand instinctively moved to her holster as she scanned the darkness. A figure 
    emerged from behind a stack of old crates, tall and menacing.
    
    "Who are you?" she demanded, her weapon now drawn and ready.
    
    The stranger smiled coldly. "Someone who's been waiting a very long time to meet you."
