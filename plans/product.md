## **3. Realistic Use Case**

**Scenario:**
A Nigerian fantasy writer publishes a serialized story of 50 chapters.

1. First 5 chapters are free → ad-supported revenue.
2. Remaining chapters require **coins** to unlock → microtransaction revenue.
3. Premium readers subscribe monthly → writer receives proportional subscription payouts.
4. Audiobook versions are available → monetized separately.
5. A small animation studio discovers the story and licenses adaptation rights → writer receives majority of licensing fees; platform takes transaction cut.

**Outcome:**

* Writer earns consistently without needing lawyers or publishers.
* Platform profits scale with story engagement.
* Intellectual property is legally protected.
